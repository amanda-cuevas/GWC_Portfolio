  <div> <font color="#1900b5" size="6" face="Helvetica"> Amanda Cuevas is a 16 year old "girl" (read: egg) who plans on becoming a computer science major. She enjoys playing videogames, reading (and sometimes even writing) books, hanging out with friends, and going on Netflix. Amanda is a recovering meme addict who often spirals back into her addiction. Currently, she uses books, movies, and tv shows as a method of procrastination and distracting her from her responsibilities. </font> </div>
  <div> <font color="#fd51e8" size="6" face="Helvetica"> Likes: reading, eating, playing video games, watching television and movies, and making people laugh. </font> </div>
  <div> <font color="#3d8822" size="6" face="Helvetica"> Dislikes: League of Legends, beans, crab meat, chemistry, and history. </font> </div>
  <div> <font color="#cd2413" size="6" face="Helvetica"> My idea of robotics changed because I learned that robots are not only the big, fancy, humanoid machines we see portrayed in tv shows and movies, but that there are many small robots as well. Learning about self-driving cars, Toymail, drones, and the development of artificial intelligence makes me really excited for the future of robotics. Of course, possible security concerns would make me nervous, but I'm sure protocols will eventually be installed to minimize danger of these tools. It can only be expected that these things will not be perfect at first, so it is reassuring that these are all mostly maintained in testing/thorough debugging programs. I liked the idea behind the flow of the circuit. I believe that teamwork really worked out in our favor. Next time, I wish to better understand why (in our case) we required a parallel circuit to light two of the LEDs.  </font> </div>
