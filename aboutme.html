She enjoys playing videogames, reading (and sometimes even writing) books, hanging out with friends, and going on Netflix. Amanda is a recovering meme addict who often spirals back into her addiction. Currently, she uses books, movies, and tv shows as a method of procrastination and distracting her from her responsibilities. </font> </div>

However, when she is determined about something (and this seems to be a rare occasion), there is nothing that can stop her. Furthermore, she is also an incredibly loyal and caring friend who someday dreams of starting a family that not only consists of her own kids, but her close future peers as well.";

Learning about self-driving cars, Toymail, drones, and the development of artificial intelligence makes me really excited for the future of robotics. Of course, possible security concerns would make me nervous, but I'm sure protocols will eventually be installed to minimize danger of these tools. It can only be expected that these things will not be perfect at first, so it is reassuring that these are all mostly maintained in testing/thorough debugging programs. I liked the idea behind the flow of the circuit. I believe that teamwork really worked out in our favor. Next time, I wish to better understand why (in our case) we required a parallel circuit to light two of the LEDs.  </font> </div>
