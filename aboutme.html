  <div> <font color="#dd083e" size="6" face="Helvetica"> Amanda Cuevas is a 16 year old "girl" (read: egg) who plans on becoming a computer science major. She enjoys playing videogames, reading (and sometimes even writing) books, hanging out with friends, and going on Netflix. Amanda is a recovering meme addict who often spirals back into her addiction. Currently, she uses books, movies, and tv shows as a method of procrastination and distracting her from her responsibilities. </font> </div>
